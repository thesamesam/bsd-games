	"	Once in a great while, when the positions of the  stars  are\n"
	"	just  right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg. Then,\n"
	"	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a  toad,\n"
	"	to  squat  upon  the  egg, keeping it warm and helping it to\n"
	"	hatch. When it hatches, out comes a creature  called  basil-\n"
	"	isk, or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures. A sin-\n"
	"	gle glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes  will  kill\n"
	"	both  man  and beast. Its power of destruction is said to be\n"
	"	so great that sometimes simply to hear its  hiss  can  prove\n"
	"	fatal.  Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vege-\n"
	"	tation to wither.\n"
	"	There is, however, one  creature  which  can  withstand  the\n"
	"	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel. No one knows\n"
	"	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay  the\n"
	"	basilisk,  it will itself be killed in the struggle. Perhaps\n"
	"	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness: if  it  ever\n"
	"	sees  its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instant-\n"
	"	ly. But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for  it  is  said\n"
	"	that merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to\n"
	"	sicken and die.\n"
